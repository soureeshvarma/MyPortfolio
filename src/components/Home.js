            I'm a highly motivated Frontend Developer based in Hyderabad, India, with a strong foundation in web technologies and a passion for crafting clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces. I specialize in building modern web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to create seamless digital experiences that are both intuitive and visually engaging. I pay close attention to detail, design with purpose, and always aim to build interfaces that reflect the unique voice of each brand or individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            I take pride in writing clean code, designing responsive layouts, and turning ideas into pixel-perfect websites that not only function smoothly but also leave a lasting impression.
